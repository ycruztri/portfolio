                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> Hello! I am Yulianna Cruz-Trinidad, and I am from San Diego, California. 
                    I am currently a student at Brown University studying computer science, 
                    interested in a full stack software engineer career. <br> <br>
                    My journey into the field of software engineering started during a 
                    transformative middle school field trip, where I had the privilege of 
                    engaging with a software engineer. Her profound dedication and articulate 
                    exposition of her projects left a lasting impression, inspiring me to pursue
                     a similar path with unwavering determination and enthusiasm. <br> <br>
                    In my free time, I  love going to the beach, playing card games, or 
                    taking pictures of beautiful scenery. </p>
