            <h1>Context/Problem</h1>
            <p>Bagel Gourmet Cafe, known for its delicious breakfast sandwiches, lacked an online presence that 
                matched the quality of its offerings. The existing website suffered from usability issues, 
                including poor accessibility, responsiveness, and visual design, hindering user engagement and 
                potentially driving away customers.
            </p>
            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>Conducting an analysis of the website revealed key points:
                <ul>
                    <li>User frustration due to difficulty in accessing essential information like menu, location, and contact details</li>
                    <li>Challenges navigating the website on smaller screens</li>
                    <li>Visual clutter and lack of hierarchy, making it hard for users to focus on important content</li>
                    <li>Accessibility issues, including poor color contrast and missing alt text for images, affecting users with disabilities</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, conducting research to find the ideal website layout that would increase the online presence was essential. </p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <h2>Identifying Usability Problems:</h2>
            <p>Through a thorough examination and the aid of accessibility tools like WAVE, I was able to pinpoint critical issues undermining the user experience.</p>
            <img class="casepic" src="./images/wave.png" alt="Image demonstrating running original website through WAVE" aria-label="Image demonstrating running original website through WAVE"/>
            <h2>Visual Redesign:</h2>
            <p>Employing speed sketching and low-fidelity wireframing techniques, I explored various design possibilities while addressing identified problems.</p>
            <p>Speed Sketching</p>
            <img class="casepic" src="./images/Sketch1.png" alt="6 speed sketches"/>
            <img class="big" src="./images/Sketch2.png" alt="3 speed sketches"/>
            <p>Final Sketch</p>
            <img class="casepic" src="./images/FinalSketch.png" alt="Final design sketch"/>
            <p>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</p>
            <p>Mobile:</p>
            <img class="casepic" src="./images/Low-Fi-M.png" alt="Low Fidelity Framework for Mobile"/>
            <p>Tablet: </p>
            <img class="casepic" src="./images/Low-Fi-T.png" alt="Low Fidelity Framework for Tablet"/>
            <p>Desktop: </p>

            <img class="casepic" src="./images/Low-Fi-D2.png" alt="Low Fidelity Framework for Desktop (2)"/>

            <h2>Iterative Design Evolution:</h2>
            <p>With each iteration, I iteratively refined the designs, balancing aesthetics with usability and ensuring responsiveness across different devices.</p>
            <h2>Accessibility Improvements:</h2> 
            <p>Prioritizing accessibility, I enhanced color contrast, added alt text for images, and optimized navigation for screen readers.</p> 
           

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>Mobile Redesign: The redesigned mobile interface prominently displays key information, ensuring effortless navigation on smaller screens. It also has a clear hierarchy and improved contrast to enhance readability and accessibility.</p>
