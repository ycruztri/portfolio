            <h1>Context/Problem</h1>
            <p>miFonda, a Google Venture Startup, sought to enhance the user experience of their Fonda Kitchen App used by restaurant staff and managers. 
                The existing app faced challenges in efficiency and ease of use, hindering the swift management of menu items and orders within restaurant kitchens.
            </p>
            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>For this project, our team research the competitors to see how they managed to organize the menu in a cohesive way that made sense to restaurant staff. We 
                found that the menu flows better when categoraized by meal times, thus we decided to take our design in that direction. 
            </p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <h2>Identifying Usability Problems:</h2>
            <p>Through collaborative discussions and feedback sessions, our team identified key pain points and formulated design questions to address them effectively. </p>
            <p>Analysis of the existing Fonda Kitchen App revealed several usability issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty in making quick and accurate adjustments to menu items.</li>
                <li>Lack of customization options and streamlined workflows for kitchen staff.</li>
                <li>Confusing screen prioritization and navigation hindering task completion.</li>
                <li>Challenges in handling menu item adjustments and ensuring generalizability across multiple restaurants.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Sketching and Wireframing:</h2> 
            <p>Each team member generated multiple sketches and low-fidelity wireframes exploring different design approaches, focusing on improving menu management and user interaction.</p>
            <h2>Iterative Design Evolution:</h2> 
            <p>Incorporating feedback from peers and stakeholders, we refined our designs iteratively, ensuring alignment with user needs and project goals while maintaining consistency and efficiency.</p>
            <h2>High-Fidelity Prototyping:</h2> 
            <p>Transitioning from low-fidelity to high-fidelity prototypes, we developed a visually appealing and interactive interface, incorporating feedback from stakeholders and ensuring usability across various devices.</p>
           

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>The redesigned Fonda Kitchen App features an intuitive interface that allows kitchen staff to make quick adjustments to menu items, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
                We also ensured consistency between the app's interface and customer-facing menu layouts, simplifying the user experience and improving internal communication within restaurants.
                By introducing customizable interface options and streamlined workflows, we empowered kitchen staff to tailor the app to their specific needs, optimizing task completion and efficiency.
                The redesigned app prioritizes essential elements on each screen, minimizing user effort and enhancing overall usability.

            <h1>Learnings</h1>
            <p>From this project, I learned that understanding your costumer is essential in addressing usability challenges and optimizing user experience.
                By researching the competitors, I was able to understand the consumer and learned how to cater to a consumer that I have not directly 
                interacted with before. This process broadened my perspective and helped me tailor the design to meet diverse user needs and preferences
                In addition, I learned that iterating through the design processes facilitates continuous improvement and refinement based on feedback 
                and user testing. Lastly, I learned just how effective communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders is crucial for 
                achieving project goals and delivering successful design solutions.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>The redesign of a page of the Fonda Kitchen App for the miFonda Startup exemplifies the importance 
                of the iterative design processes and user-centered approaches. By addressing usability challenges and enhancing 
                customization options, we were able to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of menu management and also 
                fostered a more positive and productive user experience for restaurant staff and managers.</p>
