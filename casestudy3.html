            <h1>Context/Problem</h1>
            <p>
                My team and I decided to uncover insights into how song characteristics vary across season, their impact on 
                popularity, and the association between genres and seasons. Thus, we delve into the dataset of the 
                Billboard Hot 100 chart and the Spotify One Million Tracks dataset to pinpoint patterns. However, as we 
                analyzed the data, we encountered challenges such as incomplete data, ambiguous genre classifications, and 
                the need to ensure statistical robustness in our analyses.
            </p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <h2>Identifying Data Challenges: </h2>
            <p>We meticulously examined the dataset to pinpoint gaps and ambiguities, particularly in genre classifications. </p>
            <h2>Statistical Analysis:</h2> 
            <p>Leveraging hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques, we explored relationships between song features, popularity, and seasons.</p>
            <p>We tested the following hypothesis to determind if their is a pattern:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Seasonal Variation in Song Energy Levels</li>
                <li>Week Position and Song Popularity</li>
                <li>Association between Spotify Genre and Season</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Iterative Analysis:</h2> 
            <p>We iteratively refined our analyses, addressing data challenges and uncovering meaningful insights along the way.</p>
           

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>
                We got the following results for our hypothesis:
            </p>
            <p>For the first hypothesis, we found that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean energy levels of songs in summer and winter months.</p>
            <p>Based on our data set, we found that for hypothesis 2, as the week position increases, song popularity tends to decrease, which challenged our initial belief in a positive relationship.</p>
            <p>For the third hypothesis, we found that there is an association between Spotify genre and season.</p>
